## Submitting Homework And Projects

### Regrading Requests

Submitted assignments are eligible for regrading until the end of class; however, we have limited resources, so requests must meet the criteria below to be considered.

<details><summary><strong><u>Homework</u></strong></summary>

<br/>

You can request a regrade on your homework if you have modified your homework based on the grader's feedback. We will not accept regrade requests if you have an A+; lower grades are eligible, but requests will be at the discretion of your instructional team. (We're generally pretty open to homework regrades though.)

Before requesting a regrade, write a short note explaining what you changed on Bootcampspot so the next grader understands why your work is being regraded. You must add this note to the BCS feedback thread for assignment.

To request your regrade, send a group slack message to Sondra, Bay, and Josh. You must leave a note on your BCS homework page first - we'll bounce the request back if you haven't.

<details><summary><strong><u>Projects</u></strong></summary>

<br/>

Project regrades can be requested by any **non**-ANP (active non-participatory) students. If you are no longer eligible for a certificate, you cannot request a regrade.

There is one case where we will guarantee a regrade:

> You received a failing grade (F or incomplete) on your project and have fixed your submission so it can pass. We will always regrade these requests.

Otherwise, regrades are at the discretion of the person who graded your project. Generally, we’re more likely to accept regrade requests if:

* You were missing major parts of the project that you needed to actually create (i.e. forgetting to write a report)
  <br/>OR
* You’ve made substantial changes based on our feedback.

If we’re too backed up on other tasks, regrading projects will need to wait.

If you’d like your project regraded, send us a request over slack explaining why and what you’ve changed.
